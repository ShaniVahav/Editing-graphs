###### Directed weighted graph Graph construction, editing options and graphical interface


## About the project.
Given a json file, which contains values of vertices and directed and weighted edges, we construct a directed and weighted graph.
There are several editing options on the graph, such as adding / subtracting a vertex or edge, creating a new edge or a new vertex.
In addition to all the edits, various algorithms can be performed on the graph, such as finding the middle vertex,
the shortest path between two vertices, and even the traveling salseman problem (ie: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem).

## Literature review.

In our project we used several sources, some of which are:

## Simulation of elevator movement: https://youtu.be/Y7fwF-4Vxgc
The red marking indicates the 0th floor.
At the beginning of the simulation we see an orange elevator moving at a certain speed between the floors according to its calls,
Later we can see a pink elevator that represents an elevator with a higher speed that moves between the floors.
The simulation represents the case of Building B2 and calls Calls_a.
